Code tidy up: reduce the number of global variables.

Additional ARP fingerprinting options, e.g. arpsha != srcaddr.

Some OSes, e.g. OpenBSD and NetBSD, don't run man pages through tbl.
There is disagreement about what the first line in the manpage should be.
Solaris 9 says in man(1):
'\" X
Linux sarge says in groff_man(7):
.\" word
In all cases, the letters in word are "e" for eqn, "r" for refer, "t" for tbl.

Why does darwin 7.9 not have prototypes for pcap_datalink_val_to_name(),
pcap_datalink_val_to_description() and pcap_setnonblock() even though the
pcap library contains these functions?  arp-scan compiles with warnings, but
runs OK. This is on MacOS 10.3 (Panther) with Xcode tools 1.5

Add support for win32 link-layer send and receive.

Add support for Token Ring.

Support the libpcap sending function pcap_sendpacket() or pcap_inject() when
they are supported by the pcap library.  These two functions are essentially
the same, but pcap_sendpacket() came from WinPcap whereas pcap_inject() came
from OpenBSD.  Need to find portable functions to get interface IP address
and MAC address.  pcap_lookupnet() gets the network address and mask, but not
the IP address.

Investigate response packets >60 bytes long, e.g. Windows 2003 Server and
some Cisco.

Add XML output format.

./configure gives warnings on OS X Snow Leopard:

checking for ANSI C header files... rm: conftest.dSYM: is a directory
rm: conftest.dSYM: is a directory
yes

It is suspected that an upgrade to autoconf, automake and libtools will fix
this.

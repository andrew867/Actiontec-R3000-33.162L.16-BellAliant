This file gives a brief overview of the major changes between each arp-scan
release.  For more details please read the ChangeLog file.

2011-03-01 arp-scan 1.8:

* Updated IEEE OUI and IAB MAC/Vendor files.  There are now 14707 OUI entries
  and 3542 IAB entries.

* Added support for trailer ARP replies, which were used in early versions
  of BSD Unix on VAX.

* Added support for ARP packets with both 802.1Q VLAN tag and LLC/SNAP framing.

* The full help output is only displayed if specifically requested with
  arp-scan --help.  Usage errors now result in smaller help output.

* Added support for Apple Mac OS X with Xcode 2.5 and later. This allows
  arp-scan to build on Tiger, Leopard and Snow Leopard.

* Changed license from GPLv2 to GPLv3.

* Added warning about possible DoS when setting ar$spa to the destination IP
  address to the help output and man page.

* Added arp-fingerprint patterns for 2.11BSD, NetBSD 4.0, FreeBSD 7.0,
  Vista SP1, Windows 7 and Blackberry OS.

* Enabled compiler security options -fstack-protect, -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 and
  -Wformat-security if they are supported by the compiler. Also enabled extra
  warnings -Wwrite-strings and -Wextra.

* Added new "make check" tests to check packet generation, and packet decoding
  and display.

* Modified get-oui and get-iab perl scripts so they will work on systems where
  the perl interpreter is not in /usr/bin, e.g. NetBSD.

* Various minor bug fixes and improvements.

2008-07-24 arp-scan 1.7:

* new --pcapsavefile (-W) option to save the ARP response packets to a pcap
  savefile for later analysis with tcpdump, wireshark or another program that
  supports the pcap file format.

* new --vlan (-Q) option to create outgoing ARP packets with an 802.1Q VLAN tag
  ARP responses with a VLAN tag are interpreted and displayed.

* New --llc (-L) option to create outgoing ARP packets with RFC 1042 LLC/SNAP
  framing. Received ARP packets are decoded and displayed with either
  LLC/SNAP or the default Ethernet-II framing irrespective of this option.

* Avoid double unmarshalling of packet data: once in callback, then again in
  display_packet().

* New arp-fingerprint patterns for ARP fingerprinting: Cisco 79xx IP Phone
  SIP 5.x, 6.x and 7.x; Cisco 79xx IP Phone SIP 8.x.

* Updated IEEE OUI and IAB MAC/Vendor files.  There are now 11,697 OUI entries
  and 2,386 IAB entries.

2007-04-12 arp-scan 1.6:

* arp-scan wiki at http://www.nta-monitor.com/wiki/
  This contains detailed documentation on arp-scan, and is intended to be
  the primary documentation resource.

* Added support for Sun Solaris.  Tested on Solaris 9 (SPARC).  arp-scan may
  also work on other systems that use DLPI, but only Solaris has been tested.

* New arp-fingerprint patterns for ARP fingerprinting: IOS 11.2, 11.3 and 12.4;
  ScreenOS 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4; Cisco VPN Concentrator 4.7; AIX 4.3 and 5.3;
  Nortel Contivity 6.00 and 6.05; Cisco PIX 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
  and 7.0.

* Updated IEEE OUI and IAB MAC/Vendor files.  There are now 10,214 OUI entries
  and 1,858 IAB entries.

* Added HSRP MAC address to mac-vendor.txt.

2006-07-22 arp-scan 1.5:

* Reduced memory usage from 44 bytes per target to 28 bytes.  This reduces
  the memory usage for a Class-B network from 2.75MB to 1.75MB, and a Class-A
  network from 704MB to 448MB.

* Reduced the startup time for large target ranges.  This reduces the startup
  time for a Class-A network from 80 seconds to 15 seconds on a Compaq laptop
  with 1.4GHz CPU.

* Added support for FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and MacOS X (Darwin). arp-scan
  will probably also work on other operating systems that implement BPF, but
  only those listed have been tested.

* Improved operation of the --srcaddr option.  Now this will change the
  source hardware address in the Ethernet header without changing the
  interface address.

* Additional fingerprints for arp-fingerprint.

* Improved manual pages.

* Updated IEEE OUI and IAB files.  There are now 9,426 OUI entries and 1,568
  IAB entries.

2006-06-26 arp-scan 1.4:

* Added IEEE IAB listings and associated get-iab update script and --iabfile
  option.
* Added manual MAC/Vendor mapping file: mac-vendor.txt and associated
  --macfile option.
* New --localnet option to scan all IP addresses on the specified interface
  network and mask.

2006-06-23 arp-scan 1.3:

* Initial public release.  Source distribution only, which will compile and
  run on Linux.
